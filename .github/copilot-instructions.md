Execution Guidelines
- Progress tracking: use the checklist and mark each step with a short summary.
- Communication: keep answers concise, summarize commands instead of pasting full output, note skipped steps briefly.
- Development: use the workspace root (".") as working directory; avoid extra links or media unless requested; follow any extra setup rules provided.
- Folder creation: stay within the current directory; avoid new folders unless asked (except .vscode/tasks.json when needed).
- Extension installation: install only extensions specified by get_project_setup_info.
- Project content: default to Hello World if unspecified; avoid unnecessary integrations; clarify assumptions before adding features.
- Task completion definition: project scaffolded and compiled; README and this file up to date; user has clear debug/launch guidance.

Before starting a new task, update progress in this plan.
